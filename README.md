# Haskell Projects

## This is a repository for some small projects done in Haskell during University. 

### The first project is a connect 4 game. It models a game board as a list of rows, where each row is a list of Player values (X, O, or B for blank), and was built using Game Trees and the minimax algorithm.
### The second project is a monadic compiler. It supports variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and sequences. Programs can be compiled into a virtual machine instruction set and executed, with memory and stack simulated.
